## knn mode seeking algorithm


For each input point xi:

• Define a pointer to the point within the k-nearest neighbors of xi with the highest
kNN-density.

• Repeat the process by following pointers from the initial pointer until a pointer
that points to itself is found.
  * This will be taken as the local mode of ^ fkNN(x).
